### Test in modules [noun, verb]
Hi testers and everyone affiliated with testing in any way... this one is with love from Checkout for you.
lets assume you've written more than 300 tests on average by now, one thing we don't need to assume is that you have spent more than 300 minutes waiting for them to pass/fail so far. I think we can agree, that's a lotta minutes.

In this one, we'll build a modular test framework that will allow you execute your tests through the shortest possible paths; UI or API... toward an expected assertion and we'll even throw in a web app just to make it easier to setup.

You can reuse the framework here or adapt it to your logic, lets do this. There is already enough code in here to bore you so I will rather from here on talk in points.
